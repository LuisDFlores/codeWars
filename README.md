# CodeWars Challenges
A repository filled with codewars challenges (kata) I have completed.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**  JavaScript

I wake up and start my day by challenging myself with a coding challenge.
## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.

## Lessons Learned:

The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.
